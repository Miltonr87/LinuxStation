### Milton Rodrigues LinuxStation 

This is my personal workstation as a developer. The Workstation is done with shell script and focused on my distro (Linux Mint), but it can be used by any other Debian distributions like Ubuntu if you are interested. The idea here is to speed up the process of downloading and installing important files outside the Mint Store.
